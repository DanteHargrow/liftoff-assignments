### Overview
Nowadays with different types of medias coming out on different platforms and in quick succession it's very easy to forget or mix-up release dates of your favorite things. With this app, we're proposing a central location for users to be able to search for different medias, track it via a dashboard, and have a countdown for it as well! Since it'll be user based our customers will be able to not only track the medias they want but also be able to share!
### Features
User Authenication - Each user will be able to create an account and have their own profile page
Search - Users will be able to search and add medias to their profile along with the release date and a short description.
Add posts - Users will also be able to add their own medias with the release date and a short description for other users to be able to view as well.


### Technologies
Javascript - Angular
C#
MySQL
### What I'll Have to Learn
Main thing I believe I'll have trouble with is connecting angular to an C# backend via API and/or making API calls. Will also need to know how to do user authenication in angular.
